The project aims to evaluate the feasibility of using Generative Adversarial Network to generate realistic plant images with different levels of disease (powdery mildew).
- Develop a computer vision model to segment out healhty and powdery mildew areas using Python and OpenCV 
- Apply pix2pix model to generate plant images with powdery mildew based on a sketch of healthy (green) and disease area (white) using Python and Tensorflow
