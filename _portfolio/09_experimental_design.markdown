The project aims to standardize experimental design and statistical analysis approach across different teams.
- Provide advice on evaluation and experimental design approaches, including blocking design (ICBD, Latin-square, Split-Plot) and power analysis.
- Define standardized data collection excel template across different in-vitro, in-plantae, and in-field epxeriments
- Develop statistical analysis pipelines to automate parametric test, non-parametric test, and meta-analysis for plant health research
