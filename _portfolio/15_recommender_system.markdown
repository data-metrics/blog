Our credit card team frequently sends out email marketing to customers and let them know about different merchant promotions we have with our credit cards. Previously, we select leads for such email marketing based on simple rules (customer segment, customer purchase from the same merchant category, etc). The project aims to make use of recommender system to create more personalized offers to our customers and help improve customer engagement.
- Liaise with data science team to deploy collaborative filtering recommender system for lead selection
- Design A/B testing to evaluate the recommender system's performance compared to simple rule used previously (The recommender system leads to an average of 2X lift in conversion rate across multiple merchants)
