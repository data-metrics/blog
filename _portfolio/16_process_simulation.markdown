The Business process re-engineering project aims to optimize existing processes to reduce costs.
- Liaise with different departments to map out business processes and identify potential redundant process steps
- Provide advice on data collection to gather information on item arrival date distribution, staff processing rate distribution, number of staff at each process step
- Perform Discrete-event simulation to evaluate impact of process changes to the overall throughput (The optimal process design leads to 10% cost reduction)
