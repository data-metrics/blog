The project aims to detect when an elder falls based on biomedical signal data collected from wearable sensors.
- Researched signal processing and machine learning algorithms for fall detection
- Visualized, pre-processed and annotated the signal data to create a labelled dataset ready for analysis
- Implemented data science pipeline to extract time-domain & frequency-domain features, train machine learning models, and evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance with Python and Scikit-learn
